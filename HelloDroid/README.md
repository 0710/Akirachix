2. IDEA IDE
=======================
If you don't use Gradle:

1. Open Module Settings
2. Import “appcompat” module from <android-sdk>/extras/android/support/v7
3. Add dependency to module “appcompat”

Note: When you import sample IDE automatically adds appcompact as module and as a dependency, but if not then do it yourself.
